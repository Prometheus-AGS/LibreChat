# Artifact Sharing and Viewing Report

This report certifies that the artifact sharing and viewing flow is complete and correctly implemented in the codebase. Each of the six specified requirements has been traced and verified.

## 1. Artifact is created.

**Status:** Implemented

The artifact creation process is handled by the `Artifact` component, which is responsible for extracting artifact data from its props, generating a unique key, and storing it in the application's state.

**Key Code:**

- **Component:** [`client/src/components/Artifacts/Artifact.tsx:42-128`](client/src/components/Artifacts/Artifact.tsx:42)
- **Logic:** The `updateArtifact` function within the `Artifact` component manages the creation and state update.

## 2. When artifact is shared, a URL is creating for sharing.

**Status:** Implemented

The sharing URL is generated on the client-side within the `SharedLinkButton` component. It combines the current window's location with the `/share/` path and the unique `shareId`.

**Key Code:**

- **Component:** [`client/src/components/Conversations/ConvoOptions/SharedLinkButton.tsx:75-77`](client/src/components/Conversations/ConvoOptions/SharedLinkButton.tsx:75)
- **Logic:** The `generateShareLink` function constructs the final shareable URL.

## 3. When the artifact link is used, the view that provides the artifact checks to see if the user is logged in.

**Status:** Implemented

The `ShareView` component, which renders the shared conversation, checks the user's authentication status using the `useAuthContext` hook. This status is then used to control artifact visibility and interactivity.

**Key Code:**

- **Component:** [`client/src/components/Share/ShareView.tsx:23`](client/src/components/Share/ShareView.tsx:23)
- **Logic:** The `isAuthenticated` variable holds the user's login status.

## 4. If logged in the user sees the conversation and can click the artifact button and see a full editable view that uses sandpack to show the view.

**Status:** Implemented

For authenticated users, the `useArtifactPermissions` hook sets the `artifactMode` to `interactive`, which enables the full Sandpack editor. The `Artifacts` component conditionally renders the interactive view based on this mode.

**Key Code:**

- **Permissions Hook:** [`client/src/Providers/ShareContext.tsx:50-53`](client/src/Providers/ShareContext.tsx:50)
- **Conditional Rendering:** [`client/src/components/Artifacts/Artifacts.tsx`](client/src/components/Artifacts/Artifacts.tsx:0)

## 5. If the user is not logged in, a readonly view is created that actually shows the component. there is a button to log the user in.

**Status:** Implemented

For unauthenticated users, the `isSharedReadOnly` flag is set to `true`. This causes the `Artifacts` component to render the `StaticArtifactPreview`, which displays a non-interactive view of the artifact and a login button.

**Key Code:**

- **Read-Only View:** [`client/src/components/Artifacts/Artifacts.tsx:108-164`](client/src/components/Artifacts/Artifacts.tsx:108)
- **Login Prompt:** [`client/src/components/Artifacts/Artifacts.tsx:101-105`](client/src/components/Artifacts/Artifacts.tsx:101)

## 6. If the user logs in from this page, they are returned to the page, and the page now shows the full editable and functional view using sandpack.

**Status:** Implemented

The `ShareView` component includes logic to handle the post-login redirect. It checks for a `return` URL parameter and, if present, refetches the necessary data and dispatches an event to update the UI to the interactive view.

**Key Code:**

- **Redirect Handling:** [`client/src/components/Share/ShareView.tsx:49-60`](client/src/components/Share/ShareView.tsx:49)
- **View Update:** [`client/src/components/Share/ShareView.tsx:38-46`](client/src/components/Share/ShareView.tsx:38)
